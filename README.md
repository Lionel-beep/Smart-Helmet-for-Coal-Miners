# Smart-Helmet-for-Coal-Miners
##About
A classic model of smart helmet has been developed to assist miners
working in the mining industry. Many dangerous events tend to occur in
the mining industry that can lead to life-threatening injury or prove to be
fatal. Miner's helmet is one of the most commonly used necessities for
the workers working in mines . However, helmets nowadays do not
improve the safety of miners apart from providing illumination.
Our smart helmet will be able to detect catastrophic events with the help
of various sensors viz a viz. gas sensors will detect poisonous gases like
CO, CH4, LPG and natural gases. The IR sensors will detect whether the
helmet is removed or not. Each sensor has a critical value, if reached
then the buzzer will automatically switch and LEDs will also glow
thereby giving an alert signal to the miners and supervisors.We have
integrated trackers like a GPS module to track the position of the
miners.Moreover, a Panic Button has been introduced which when
evoked, will send an emergency signal to the higher authorities outside
of the mines through mail. A mobile application has been developed
showcasing all the datas from the sensors transmitted wirelessly .
Thus, our smart helmet prevents miners from suffering anyupcoming
accidents.
